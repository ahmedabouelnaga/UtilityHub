# UtilityHub

UtilityHub is a comprehensive Java-based toolkit that combines three key functionalities: temperature conversion, time computation, and change distribution. This project is designed to demonstrate core Java programming principles while providing practical, real-world functionality.


## Overview

UtilityHub is a lightweight and versatile suite of tools designed to handle everyday computational tasks. The project combines three distinct utilities:
1. **Temperature Conversion**: Convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
2. **Time Computation**: Calculate the total minutes from given inputs of hours, days, weeks, and years.
3. **Change Distribution**: Determine the optimal distribution of change in dollars and coins.

This toolkit is designed for users looking for simple, efficient, and easy-to-use Java-based utilities.

## Features

### 1. Fahrenheit to Celsius Converter
- Prompts the user to input a temperature in Fahrenheit.
- Outputs the equivalent temperature in Celsius.
- Utilizes integer-based calculations to avoid floating-point precision errors.

### 2. Time Conversion
- Asks the user for a number of hours, days, weeks, and years.
- Calculates and displays the total minutes (ignoring leap years).

### 3. Change Calculator
- Prompts the user for the amount due and the amount received (both in pennies).
- Computes the distribution of change in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
